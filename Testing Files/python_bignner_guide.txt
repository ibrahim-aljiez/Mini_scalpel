Beginner's Guide to Python

Introduction
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.

Setting Up Python

1. Download Python from python.org.
2. Install Python and ensure you check the option "Add Python to PATH".
3. Verify installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and running:
   python --version

Basic Python Concepts

1. Variables and Data Types
   name = "John"      # String
   age = 25            # Integer
   height = 5.9        # Float
   is_student = True   # Boolean

2. Printing to Console
   print("Hello, World!")
   print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}")

3. Comments

# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""

4. Operators

# Arithmetic

x = 5 + 3   # 8
y = 10 / 2  # 5.0

# Comparison

x > y      # False
x == 8     # True

# Logical

x > 3 and y < 10  # True

5. Conditional Statements
   if age >= 18:
   print("Adult")
   else:
   print("Minor")

6. Loops

# For loop

for i in range(5):
print(i)

# While loop

count = 0
while count < 5:
print(count)
count += 1

7. Functions
   def greet(name):
   return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))

8. Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

# List

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")

# Tuple

coordinates = (10, 20)

# Dictionary

person = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
print(person["name"])

9. Reading and Writing Files

# Write to file

with open("sample.txt", "w") as f:
f.write("Hello Python")

# Read from file

with open("sample.txt", "r") as f:
content = f.read()
print(content)

10. Handling Errors
    try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input!")

Useful Tips for Beginners

* Use meaningful variable names.
* Always test small pieces of code first.
* Keep code readable with proper indentation.
* Learn to use Python's built-in documentation: help(function_name).

Next Steps
Once comfortable with the basics, explore:

* Modules and Packages (import math, random)
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Working with Libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib
* Web scraping and automation
